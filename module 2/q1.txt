1)Web Page:
	A web page is a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) that can be displayed in a web browser such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, or Apple Safari.
	Web pages are often referred to simply as “pages.”
	Each web page is linked to a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
	Web pages can contain various elements, including text, images, links, forms, and multimedia.
	For example, when you visit a news article online, that article is a web page.
2)Website:
	A website is a collection of multiple web pages grouped together and usually connected in various ways.
	Websites are hosted on web servers, which are computers accessible via the Internet.
	Each website has a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) that points to its location on the web server.
	Websites can serve various purposes, such as providing information, selling products, or offering services.
	For instance, an e-commerce site with product pages, a blog with articles, and a contact page constitutes a website.
3)Web Server:
	A web server is a computer that hosts websites on the Internet.
	It responds to requests from web browsers by sending the requested web pages.
	Web servers store the web page files and serve them to users when they access a website.
	Think of a web server as a library that houses different sections (websites) containing books (web pages).
	Each section (website) has its unique content, and the books (web pages) within it are accessible via specific URLs.
4)Search Engine:
	A search engine is a web service that helps users find other web pages.
	Popular search engines include Google, Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo.
	Users can perform searches directly in their web browsers (e.g., typing queries in the address bar) or visit search engine websites.
	Search engines index web pages, making it easier for users to discover relevant content.
	Analogously, a search index is like the catalog in a library, helping users locate specific books (web pages).
5)HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
	HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
	It defines the structure and content of a web page using tags (e.g., <p>, <h1>, <a>).
	HTML tags indicate headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and more.
	Web browsers interpret HTML to display the visual representation of a web page.
	For example, <h1> represents a top-level heading, and <a> creates a hyperlink.
6)CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
	CSS is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages.
	It allows designers to define styles (such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning) for HTML elements.
	CSS rules are applied to HTML elements to achieve consistent and visually appealing designs.
	For instance, you can use CSS to specify font sizes, background colors, and margins for different page elements
